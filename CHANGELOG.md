# Changelog

All notable changes to `ichava/icon-sets-material-symbols` follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **This pack requires `ichava/core` and nothing else.** `composer.json` `require` is now `php` and `ichava/core`; `illuminate/support` and `laranail/package-tools` were dropped from it and still arrive through core. The provider extends core's `IconPackServiceProvider` and declares its constants class and component class, so `src/` imports no `laranail/*` namespace; it registers the same name, path, Blade component and icon directory as before. The composer `type` is `ichava-icon-set`, which core's pack discovery reads. The README and `docs/installation.md` no longer restate the `laranail/*` repositories: they link to core's installation guide, the one place that lists them, and no longer say the pack is on Packagist, which no Ichava package is yet. `tests/Unit/CoreOnlyDependencyTest.php` fails if any of it comes back.
- **The pack's `NOTICE` moved to `resources/assets/svg/NOTICE`**, out of `resources/assets/svg/licenses/material-symbols/`. That directory is the one icon-sets-sync's licence sink deletes and refills with upstream's licence files on a real sync, and upstream ships no NOTICE, so the first sync would have deleted the statement of changes Apache-2.0 section 4(b) asks for (icon-sets-sync#88). `config.json`'s `license.notice`, `ATTRIBUTION.md` and the README point at the new path, and `AttributionTest` now fails if anything but `LICENSE` sits in the licence directory.
- **The upstream sync runs icon-sets-sync `06b17d7`** (icon-sets-sync#88), up from `5fa93a6`, which adds this pack's recipe, the `split-variants` and `exclude` transforms, and the `licence_sha256` pin on the upstream licence text. The `uses:` pin and `toolkit-ref` move together; the reusable workflow's inputs did not change between the two commits, so the caller's `with:` block is untouched.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-13

First release of `ichava/icon-sets-material-symbols` (pack plan rank, owner decision of 2026-11-04 to ship every planned pack in v0.1.0).

### Added

- **23,640 Material Symbols SVGs** from the `@material-symbols/svg-400` npm package (marella/material-symbols `v0.48.3`), which republishes the SVGs of google/material-design-icons, in 6 variants: `outlined` (3,940), `outlined-fill` (3,940), `rounded` (3,940), `rounded-fill` (3,940), `sharp` (3,940), `sharp-fill` (3,940). Every file went through icon-sets-sync's SVG sanitiser.
- **A size policy.** Weight 400 only, in all three styles, filled and unfilled. The other six weights (100, 200, 300, 500, 600, 700) are not vendored: they would add 141,861 files. Upstream names use underscores and are slugged to hyphens (`bullet_chart` is `bullet-chart`). Before the subset: 165,501 files, 120.6 MB unpacked (all seven weights, 100 to 700, of 0.48.3). After: 23,640 SVGs, 13.1 MB of SVG bytes, 92 MB on disk (weight 400 only).
- **Licensing kept apart.** `LICENSE` is the MIT licence for the package code; the icons are Apache-2.0, with the upstream text at `resources/assets/svg/licenses/material-symbols/LICENSE`, the pack's own `NOTICE` at `resources/assets/svg/NOTICE`, and the notice in `ATTRIBUTION.md`. `config.json` records the licence's SPDX id, SHA-256 and the date it was checked, and `AttributionTest` fails if the shipped text stops matching that hash.
- **Tests:** the provider boots and registers the pack; the variant counts, the `Variant` enum and the SVG kind are pinned; no SVG carries stray text; and the sibling, attribution, docs-shape, personal-contact, PHPStan-level, release-version, workflow-permission and sync-caller guards the other packs carry.
